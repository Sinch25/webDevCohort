        <p>Music. A beautiful form of sound that brings various people together. Music reaches hearts like none other.
            When you
            unexpectedly meet somebody at a concert vibing to the same music as you, it stems feelings of closeness and
            connection.
            When people listen to their favourite songs together, something remarkable happens in the brain- “neural
            responses
            synchronize”. This synchronization known as “neural entertainment” is a key factor in why shared musical
            activities
            often lead to stronger social bonds.<br><br>

            Impact of Music on Healing<br><br>
            Growing evidence suggests, that listening to Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major and can reduce the
            frequency of
            seizures in some people with epilepsy. So beautiful, isn’t it?
            Other conditions and diseases, ranging from Parkinson’s to depression to Alzheimer’s, could someday have
            therapeutic
            solutions derived from an understanding of music. For instance, by identifying the exact type of music able
            to provoke a
            particular cognitive, motor, or emotional response, there could be progress toward healing, improving, or
            compensating
            for disrupted brain function in various diseases. An increased understanding of brain mechanisms can
            facilitate this.<br><br>
            Impact of Music on Memory<br><br>
            Music can help retain essential information despite memory loss. Music memory is stored in the hippocampus,
            centrally
            located in the brain. Therefore, music memories are less likely to be negatively impacted by age or disease.
            A musical mnemonic device is a natural way to memorize and recall information. As children, we learn various
            academic
            and social concepts through songs. Similarly, these memory strategies are highly effective for adults. In
            fact, our
            brains automatically “fill in the gaps” when a song suddenly stops.
            Music therapists often incorporate these techniques with individuals to improve memory retention or
            developmental
            learning goals. Music may activate memories and remind us of places, events or people. A familiar tune may
            elicit the
            emotions associated with those memories.<br><br>
            Impact of Music on Metal Health<br><br>
            Music can provide comfort and solace during times of distress, allowing us to express our feelings without
            having to put
            them into words. Music can also be used as a tool for self-reflection, helping us gain insight into our own
            experiences
            and find meaning in difficult situations.
            Music has been found to be particularly beneficial for those who are grieving or suffering from trauma or
            PTSD
            (post-traumatic stress disorder). Listening to certain types of music can evoke memories of happier times,
            providing a
            sense of hope and optimism even when faced with difficult circumstances.<br><br>
            Impact of Music on Behaviour<br><br>
            Have you found yourself singing or listening to your go-to songs while performing boring, tiresome and
            tedious tasks?
            This is mostly due to the fact that music can be a motivator, a time for completing tasks or a mood
            enhancer. Music can
            validate your current emotional state and influence your emotional destination.<br><br>
            Overall, music is a bewitching and elegant tool for self-expression, recognition and connection.
            Our lives are all shaped by music and always will be.
