        <p>It is a phenomenon where drugs, treatments and therapies that aren’t supposed to have an effect and often
            fake make
            people feel better.<br><br>The phrase placebo is derived from the Latin phrase “I shall please”
            In 1996,56 volunteers took part in a study to test a new pain-killer called “Trivaricaine.”<br><br> On every
            volunteer one index
            finger was covered in a new pain-killer while the other remained untouched. Then both were squeezed in
            painful clamps.
            The volunteers reported that the treated finger hurt less than the untreated one. The twist is Trivaricaine
            wasn’t even
            a pain-killer it was a fake concotion with no pain easing property at all. The volunteers felt that the
            pain-killer
            worked even though it was fake was because of the placebo effect.Placebo had to be identical to real
            treatments in order to be convincing, hence they took the form of sugar pills,
            water-filled injections and shame surgeries(fake surgeries).<br><br>
            The active ingredient is expectation, they work because we expect them to. Thanks to the placebo effect,
            patience have
            experienced relief from range of ailments even though all they received was a fake drug or shame surgery.
            Researchers
            think that if a person believes a fake treatment is real, their expectations of recovery actually do trigger
            physiological factors that improve their symptoms.<br><br>
            Placebo’s seem to be capable of causing measurable change in blood pressure, heart rate and the release of
            pain-reducing
            chemicals like endorphins. Placebo’s even reduce levels of stress hormones like adrenaline, which can slow
            the harmful
            effects of an ailment.<br><br>
            The placebo eff ect even has it’s cons. If somebody believes a fake treatment has cured them, they may miss
            out on drugs
            or therapies that are proven to work. The positive effect may fade over time and they often do fade.
            Placebo’s also have an influence on clinical results which motivate scientists to discover how it yields
            such power.<br><br>
            Despite the fact that we know a lot about the human body, there are still some strange and enduring
            mysteries like the
            placebo effect.</p>
